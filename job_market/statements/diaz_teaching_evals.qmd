The following tables present a summary of my teaching evaluations. Scores range from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most positive. Detailed evaluations available upon request.

# McMaster University

In Spring 2023, only 1 student completed the evaluations for my data analysis for public opinion and policy course. This may have happened due to a change in the online platform for teaching evaluation surveys in the previous semester.

## Selected comments from students at Tulane

- "Professor Diaz is very understanding and does a great job applying concepts to class discussions and the out-of-class assignments reflect the key concepts of the course."

- "I appreciated the flexible exam structure and edits made to the syllabus as a result of the challenges of this semester. I enjoyed the News Report assignments as they were an interesting way to interact with the course content in a meaningful way."

- "The organization of content felt extremely coherent as we built on every previous module. This is no small feat given the subject matter. The mixture of quizzes and News Report assignments kept the course from being stale while still testing our knowledge of course material from differing vectors."
