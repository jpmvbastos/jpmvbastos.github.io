I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Agricultural & Applied Economics, and a Research Assistant at the [Free Market Institute](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/freemarketinstitute/), both at Texas Tech University.  

My [research](https://jpmvbastos.com/research.html) focuses on the political economy of development. I am particularly interested in answering empirical questions about the role of economic and political institutions for development within the Latin American context, using modern causal inference techniques.

My [Job Market Paper]("../files/research/Job Market Paper - JP Bastos.pdf") investigates the private returns to political office for Brazilian mayors, using a regression discountinuity design around close election races. 

I have worked as a policy analyst in the Executive and Legislative branches of City of Porto Alegre, Brazil, where I got to work on important economic reforms. I discuss policy issues as a regular contributor to [Exame](https://exame.com/autor/joao-pedro-bastos/), and my policy papers have been featured in some of the most popular media outlets in Brazil.

I also run the [Public Choice in Latin America](https://publicchoicelatinamerica.substack.com/) project, with Nicolás Cachanosky.
