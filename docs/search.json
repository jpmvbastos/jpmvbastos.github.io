    "text": "Methodological contribution\nThis is part of Gustavo’s broader research program on navigating research design tradeoffs in experiments. It’s the second project in a series about tradeoffs in list experiments.\nThe first paper in the series is accepted at JEPS. In other collaborations, I discuss tradeoffs in field and survey experiments in general. This recent example is currently under review.\nThe main methodological takeaway from the project is to remind researchers that we can get additional leverage in studies of sensitive attitudes or behaviors in surveys by including and combining estimates from different questioning techniques.\nThis point was already made in a piece by Aronow et al (2015). Researchers cite this article to justify the inclusion of direct questions in list experiments, but they tend to forget that you can do more than simply comparing direct question and list experiment estimates side-by-side.\nAt a minimum, our contribution should be read as a reminder that people should be combining estimates more often."

    "section": "Substantive contribution",
    "text": "Substantive contribution\nThis project is part of a broader research agenda trying to understand why criminal organizations remain embedded in contexts where state capacity is high and overall crime is low.\nThe main explanation is that criminal organizations replace the state there where the state cannot reach. Hence the focus on criminal governance strategies in the literature (Lessing 2020).\nOur project aims to describe as accurately as possible the extent of criminal governance strategies in the city of Montevideo, Uruguay. This is a case where the state was heavily invested on reducing crime both through increased police presence and social policy reform around the turn of the century. The traditional state capacity explanation would not predict persistent criminal governance strategies in this case, but we still see them to this day.\nOur main argument is that a context of high state presence limits criminal governance strategies to economic mechanisms. So, for example, we would see gangs evicting neighbors from their homes or offering jobs, but we would not see them acting as focal points for conflict resolution among individuals as they do in other contexts (we measure this in a different part of the survey).\nWe chose four negative and four positive activities as sensitive items for the list experiment and network scale-up questions. These came up from interviews with officials and citizens in the field. Our qualitative fieldwork helped us identify realistic criminal governance strategies to focus on, and helped us notice that discussing them is a sensitive issue, which informs our research design (Pérez Bentancur and Tiscornia 2022)."

    "text": "Miscellaneous\n\nWe block randomized by police designated areas based on crime victimization. We have two blocks, one for higher crime rates and one for lower crime rates. Our experimental estimates adjust for this.\nWe followed the advice in the list experiments literature to include a placebo item to control list to avoid artificial inflation in estimates (e.g. Riambau and Ostwald 2021). This decision backfired since all of our estimates are close to zero. We have ruled out other potential problems in list experiments by applying the standard battery of validity checks. We are writing a separate paper about how to avoid this problem and recover estimates when placebo statements obscure prevalence rate estimates in list experiments."

    "text": "I write to express my interest in your call for an Assistant Professor. I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Political Science at McMaster University. I specialize in comparative politics and quantitative methods. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Jake Bowers, Matt Winters, Gisela Sin, and Avital Livny.\n\n\nSubstantively, I research the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South. Methodologically, I use tools from design-based causal inference and computational social science to develop standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in experiments and quasi-experiments. My work is published or forthcoming in World Development and The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, and the Journal of Experimental Political Science.\n\n\n\nThe core of my primary agenda is an original data collection effort in Brazil, combining text analysis and machine learning to construct the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions at the local level. This dataset informs several of my ongoing research projects. For example, in a solo-authored working paper, I argue that corruption revelation drives politicians in nearby municipalities to undertake preemptive behavior to ward off a negative reaction from their constituents. While previous literature suggests that partisans might react strategically to anticipate sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, my work shows that this behavior is even more widespread, and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing.\n\nI also maintain a research program on the gendered electoral consequences of corruption with Kelly Senters Piazza (US Air Force Academy). In a forthcoming book chapter, we use my corruption infractions dataset to show how corruption revelation increases the proportion of female candidates running for mayor, but not their chances of winning elections. We attribute this to incumbents’ incentives to counter the rise of female politicians. In another forthcoming chapter, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of different data sources to study gender and corruption.\nThis program extends toward the gendered evaluations of officeholders’ performance in general. In a piece in World Development, we discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to promote female political representation through increased discontent with the performance of male-led executives and by priming a health policy issue commonly associated with women. In work under review with Virginia Oliveros (Tulane), Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro (Brown), and Matt Winters (Illinois), we use a survey experiment in Argentina to show gendered differential reactions to policy implementation.\n\nThis research agenda has also led me to produce methodological work to improve our ability to detect hard-to-observe social and political phenomena. I focus on how scholars can navigate research design tradeoffs before data collection. For example, in an article accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I introduce new tools to assess the validity of estimates in double list experiments. This is a variant of the list experiment that promises more precise results but comes with under-explored questionnaire design complications.\n\nMy experience as a methodology and area studies postdoc at two separate institutions has given me the opportunity to teach courses in comparative and quantitative methods. At McMaster, I teach an applied research design course for public opinion and public policy. At Tulane, I taught an introductory course in comparative politics and a senior seminar on the challenges of developing democracies from an evidence-informed policy perspective. My work as the methods editorial assistant for the American Political Science Review also puts me in a unique position to gain exposure to the most current methods in the field, awareness of which I can incorporate into my teaching and mentoring.\nMy time at Illinois also gave me extensive teaching experience. I taught an online course on the politics of developing countries as an independent instructor and served as a teaching assistant for its in-person version. I also served as a teaching assistant for quantitative research methods courses at the undergraduate and PhD levels using a flipped classroom approach. These experiences have prepared me to teach to a diverse student body and to adapt to both online and in-person platforms.\n\n\n\nI am prepared to teach courses on democracy and representation, comparative politics, politics of the Global South, evidence-informed policy, research design, statistics, experiments, causal inference, machine learning, and computational social science. You can find copies of current and sample syllabi in my website. As a first-generation scholar, my teaching philosophy emphasizes building flexible learning environments for students with different backgrounds and career goals.\n\nI believe my expertise makes me an excellent fit at American University.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in Advanced Statistical, Causal Inference, and Computational Methodologies in the Department of Political Science at McMaster University. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Jake Bowers, Matt Winters, Gisela Sin, and Avital Livny.\nMy research uses tools from computational social science and design-based causal inference to develop standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in the social sciences. I apply these ideas to questions of accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South. My work is published or forthcoming in outlets including World Development, the Journal of Experimental Political Science, and The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations.\n\n\n\nMy research agenda focuses on developing tools that researchers can adopt to improve statistical precision before data collection. This is overlooked in the statistics, econometrics, and political methodology literature in favor of identifying unbiased estimators. Implicitly, this literature assumes that one can improve statistical precision by increasing sample size. This is not feasible in many social science applications due to resource limitations. Moreover, resource considerations aside, even the least intrusive study has an ethical mandate to identify a research design that maximizes benefits and minimizes harm at the lowest possible cost.\nFocusing on field and survey experiments, this agenda follows two strands. First, I examine cases where one can improve statistical precision without sacrificing unbiasedness, which implies unforeseen costs in other dimensions. For example, in work under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we show how implementing alternatives to the standard experimental design, such as pre-post outcome measurement or block randomization, may attenuate the expected gains in precision via explicit or implicit sample loss. In a solo-authored piece accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I introduce new tools to assess the validity of estimates in double list experiments. This is a variant of the list experiment that promises more precise results but comes with under-explored questionnaire design complications. In work in progress with Inés Fynn (Universidad Católica del Uruguay), Verónica Pérez Bentancur (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we show how to combine list experiments with network scale up questions to improve the precision of prevalence rate estimates for sensitive attitudes and behaviors at the cost one additional assumption.\nThe second strand focuses on cases where one can improve precision by sacrificing unbiasedness deliberately. For example, in work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet precise estimators to analyze experimental data, including applications to block-randomization and M-estimation. In a SAGE Handbook chapter with Christopher Grady and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois), we discuss the merits and challenges of increasingly complex survey experimental designs that improve precision at the cost of external validity bias.\n\n\nI have experience teaching courses on quantitative methods and comparative politics. At McMaster, I teach data analysis for public policy and public opinion. At Tulane, I taught a seminar on evidence-informed policy to address social and political challenges in developing democracies. Both courses emphasize experimental and quasi-experimental designs for causal inference. At Illinois, I served as a teaching assistant for statistics courses at the undergraduate and PhD levels using a flipped classroom approach. I also served as a math camp instructor for incoming graduate students for three consecutive years. I also have experience teaching introduction to comparative politics in a hybrid format and an online course on the politics of developing countries.\nMy involvement beyond the classroom also complements my teaching and mentoring. My work as the methods editorial assistant for the American Political Science Review exposes me to cutting-edge methods in the field. As a PhD student at Illinois, I started a collaborative project in which graduate students introduced their peers to new methods and organized a reading group on computational social science methods.\nThese experiences have prepared me to teach to a diverse student body, to adapt to both online and in-person platforms, and to teach both the theory and application of quantitative methods.\n\n\n\nI am prepared to teach courses on statistics, causal inference, experiments, computational social science, machine learning, evidence-informed policy, and the politics of the Global South. You can find copies of current and sample syllabi in my website. As a first-generation scholar, my teaching philosophy emphasizes using the language of the social sciences as a tool to advance the careers of students with different backgrounds and goals.\n\nI believe my expertise makes me an excellent fit at the EUI.

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\n\nAccording to Freedom House, 2022 marks the 17th consecutive year with available data in which the number of countries where democracy deteriorated outnumbers the number of countries where democracy improved. This trend emerges after several decades of continuous democratization and highlights the difficult path that separates democratization and consolidation.\nThis period is also marked by redoubled efforts by scholars, governments, and civil society organizations to identify and overcome the challenges to democracy around the world. Progress in research transparency and registration has lead to more coordinated efforts to produce credible evidence to determine what works, where, and why.\nMy research focuses on the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South. This is an area where strategic behavior from both citizens and politicians precludes the identification of successful interventions. My current agenda analyzes the unintended electoral consequences of investigating and exposing corruption, as well as the gendered patterns in citizens’ evaluation of politicians’ performance in office.\nGiven the focus on hard-to-observe phenomena, this substantive agenda also informs a methodological program on the application of tools from design-based causal inference and computational social science to navigate research design trade-offs before data collection in experiments and quasi-experiments.\n\n\nThe literature in political science and economics on electoral accountability highlights voters’ adverse selection problem: They prefer to have good over bad elected officials but they can only infer an incumbent’s type through observable outputs of their performance. Therefore, corrupt incumbents have incentives to hide illicit activities and appear good. To fight corruption, governments, civil society organizations, and scholars devote considerable resources to implementing and evaluating anti-corruption interventions that attempt to bridge the information gap between voters and politicians’ performance in office. However, the cumulative evidence suggests that these interventions rarely translate into voters sanctioning corrupt incumbents.\nA recent explanation for the lack of electoral sanctions is that politicians undertake preemptive behavior to ward off the negative consequences of corruption. For example, previous research shows that political parties avoid nominating legislators investigated for corruption to reelection. On the other side of the coin, research also shows that local level elected officials switch away from parties investigated for corruption after securing reelection. In short, politicians avoid direct association with corruption.\nPrevious research on electoral accountability shows that politicians try to minimize the electoral consequences of investigating and exposing corruption. I expand on this research in work funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian studies at the University of Illinois, using data from a long-running anti-corruption program in Brazil that randomly selects municipalities to audit their use of federal funds, and combining text analysis and machine learning to create the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions to date. I make two contributions to the literature.\nFirst, in a working paper, I argue that the main reason why politicians update their behavior in reaction to increased monitoring is because they expect increased scrutiny from their constituents. This contrasts from previous work suggesting that the primary incentive is top-down enforcement. I show that being selected for auditing leads mayors to shift public spending in a attempt to minimize the chances of uncovering irregularities. Mayors selected for auditing spend less when they are eligible for reelection and when the audits are announced close to an election year. This runs counter to previous evidence in political business cycles, which suggests that heightened electoral concerns lead to an increase in public spending.\nIn another working paper, I argue that politicians are also responsive to revealed corruption even when they are not directly connected to it. Whereas previous literature has shown evidence that partisans might react strategically to anticipated sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, I argue that this behavior is even more widespread and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing. This occurs because officeholders expect their constituencies to receive the news of corruption in nearby localities and react with increased scrutiny on their performance. I show that mayors in municipalities exposed to nearby corruption are more likely to seek reelection under a different party, and that they do so in a pattern that suggests an attempt to secure more resources for reelection.\n\n\n\nIn work with Kelly Senters Piazza (US Air Force Academy), we expand this agenda toward the gendered patterns that underlie how voters evaluate politicians’ performance in office in light of corruption. In a forthcoming book chapter in Norms, Gender and Corruption: Understanding the Nexus, we use my data on corruption infractions at the local level in Brazil to revisit previous findings on the gendered electoral consequences of corruption. Previous work in this topic uses public opinion data and survey experiments to show how revealing corruption increases support for female representation, yet also how female politicians face harsher sanctions for comparable levels of wrongdoing. We show that revealing corruption increases support for female representation in the form of an increased proportion of female candidates running for mayor, yet this support does not translate into an increased proportion of women winning elections, which we attribute to incumbent mayors’ incentives to counter the rise of female challengers.\nThis program extends to the study of gendered performance evaluations beyond corruption. In a piece in World Development, we highlight how exceptional events, such as corruption, conflict, and public health disasters, can promote female political representation by raising questions around the ability of male leadership to handle crises, as well as priming voters about issues around which women are perceived to have policy expertise. Examining public opinion data and recent media coverage around the world, we argue for the presence of both mechanisms in the COVID-19 global pandemic, implying a potential surge in female political representation.\nIn work under review with Virginia Oliveros (Tulane), Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro (Brown), and Matt Winters (Illinois), we use a survey experiment in Argentina to study gendered differential reactions to policy implementation. Previous work suggests that women face higher scrutiny for their performance in office However, in the context of the implementation of a food distribution program, we find that voters are only responsive to performance information (positive or negative) among male officeholders and tend to ignore performance information when told that an officeholder is a woman. We attribute this result to voters’ perception of male politicians as the default category, thus providing no new information on top of performance. In turn, mentioning the gender of a female politician leads voters to believe that good performance stems from factors beyond the incumbent’s control.\n\n\n\nThe focus on corruption and performance evaluations in my work has led me to contribute to the development of tools to improve our ability to detect or measure hard-to-observe social and political phenomena. This agenda currently focuses on survey and field experiments. In the future, I plan expand toward quasi-experiments and observational studies.\nFor example, in a manuscript accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I revisit double list experiments. Social scientists use list experiments in surveys when respondents may conceal their answer to sensitive questions. When their assumptions are met, list experiments reduce sensitivity biases from misreporting. However, they tend to produce estimates with high variance, which prevents researchers from improving upon direct questioning. Double list experiments promise to remedy this by implementing two parallel list experiments and then aggregating their results, which roughly halves the variance of the estimate for the prevalence of the sensitive trait. This implies an estimator that is more precise and still unbiased, but their implementation brings the question over whether the aggregation of the results of two parallel experiments yields a valid estimate. I propose a statistical test to assess the validity of estimates from double list experiments by leveraging variation in the order in which respondents receive the sensitive item, which provides researchers with a tool to apply this technique more widely.\nAs another example, in work under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting a research design feature aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision, but it may require contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates before treatment and then post-treatment outcomes. This creates space for either explicit (e.g. subjects dropping from the study between waves) or implicit sample loss (e.g. resource limitation forcing researchers to halve the sample size). Both forms of sample loss may offset the precision gains of blocking. Both standard and block randomized experiments have well-known unbiased estimators, but one must choose whether to block or not depending on the expected gains in precision. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage."

However, the cumulative evidence suggests that these interventions rarely translate into voters sanctioning corrupt incumbents.\nA recent explanation for the lack of electoral sanctions is that politicians undertake preemptive behavior to ward off the negative consequences of corruption. For example, previous research shows that political parties avoid nominating legislators investigated for corruption to reelection. On the other side of the coin, research also shows that local level elected officials switch away from parties investigated for corruption after securing reelection. In short, politicians avoid direct association with corruption.\nPrevious research on electoral accountability shows that politicians try to minimize the electoral consequences of investigating and exposing corruption. I expand on this research in work funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian studies at the University of Illinois, using data from a long-running anti-corruption program in Brazil that randomly selects municipalities to audit their use of federal funds, and combining text analysis and machine learning to create the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions to date. I make two contributions to the literature.\nFirst, in a working paper, I argue that the main reason why politicians update their behavior in reaction to increased monitoring is because they expect increased scrutiny from their constituents. This contrasts from previous work suggesting that the primary incentive is top-down enforcement. I show that being selected for auditing leads mayors to shift public spending in a attempt to minimize the chances of uncovering irregularities. Mayors selected for auditing spend less when they are eligible for reelection and when the audits are announced close to an election year. This runs counter to previous evidence in political business cycles, which suggests that heightened electoral concerns lead to an increase in public spending.\nIn another working paper, I argue that politicians are also responsive to revealed corruption even when they are not directly connected to it. Whereas previous literature has shown evidence that partisans might react strategically to anticipated sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, I argue that this behavior is even more widespread and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing. This occurs because officeholders expect their constituencies to receive the news of corruption in nearby localities and react with increased scrutiny on their performance. I show that mayors in municipalities exposed to nearby corruption are more likely to seek reelection under a different party, and that they do so in a pattern that suggests an attempt to secure more resources for reelection.\n\n\n\nIn work with Kelly Senters Piazza (US Air Force Academy), we expand this agenda toward the gendered patterns that underlie how voters evaluate politicians’ performance in office in light of corruption. In a forthcoming book chapter in Norms, Gender and Corruption: Understanding the Nexus, we use my data on corruption infractions at the local level in Brazil to revisit previous findings on the gendered electoral consequences of corruption. Previous work in this topic uses public opinion data and survey experiments to show how revealing corruption increases support for female representation, yet also how female politicians face harsher sanctions for comparable levels of wrongdoing. We show that revealing corruption increases support for female representation in the form of an increased proportion of female candidates running for mayor, yet this support does not translate into an increased proportion of women winning elections, which we attribute to incumbent mayors’ incentives to counter the rise of female challengers.\nThis program extends to the study of gendered performance evaluations beyond corruption. In a piece in World Development, we highlight how exceptional events, such as corruption, conflict, and public health disasters, can promote female political representation by raising questions around the ability of male leadership to handle crises, as well as priming voters about issues around which women are perceived to have policy expertise. Examining public opinion data and recent media coverage around the world, we argue for the presence of both mechanisms in the COVID-19 global pandemic, implying a potential surge in female political representation.\nIn work under review with Virginia Oliveros (Tulane), Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro (Brown), and Matt Winters (Illinois), we use a survey experiment in Argentina to study gendered differential reactions to policy implementation. Previous work suggests that women face higher scrutiny for their performance in office However, in the context of the implementation of a food distribution program, we find that voters are only responsive to performance information (positive or negative) among male officeholders and tend to ignore performance information when told that an officeholder is a woman. We attribute this result to voters’ perception of male politicians as the default category, thus providing no new information on top of performance. In turn, mentioning the gender of a female politician leads voters to believe that good performance stems from factors beyond the incumbent’s control.\n\n\n\nThe focus on corruption and performance evaluations in my work has led me to contribute to the development of tools to improve our ability to detect or measure hard-to-observe social and political phenomena. This agenda currently focuses on survey and field experiments. In the future, I plan expand toward quasi-experiments and observational studies.\nFor example, in a manuscript accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I revisit double list experiments. Social scientists use list experiments in surveys when respondents may conceal their answer to sensitive questions. When their assumptions are met, list experiments reduce sensitivity biases from misreporting. However, they tend to produce estimates with high variance, which prevents researchers from improving upon direct questioning. Double list experiments promise to remedy this by implementing two parallel list experiments and then aggregating their results, which roughly halves the variance of the estimate for the prevalence of the sensitive trait. This implies an estimator that is more precise and still unbiased, but their implementation brings the question over whether the aggregation of the results of two parallel experiments yields a valid estimate. I propose a statistical test to assess the validity of estimates from double list experiments by leveraging variation in the order in which respondents receive the sensitive item, which provides researchers with a tool to apply this technique more widely.\nAs another example, in work under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting a research design feature aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision, but it may require contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates before treatment and then post-treatment outcomes. This creates space for either explicit (e.g. subjects dropping from the study between waves) or implicit sample loss (e.g. resource limitation forcing researchers to halve the sample size). Both forms of sample loss may offset the precision gains of blocking. Both standard and block randomized experiments have well-known unbiased estimators, but one must choose whether to block or not depending on the expected gains in precision. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage."

Doing this credibly requires creativity in research design, as researchers must try to anticipate the challenges to inference even before conducting data analysis.\nMy research develops standards to navigate the tradeoffs that emerge when one considers research design alternatives before data collection.

My current agenda focuses on the design of field and survey experiments. In the future, I plan to expand to causal inference in quasi-experiments and observational studies.\nI apply the insights of my methodological work to questions of accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South. The common theme in these applications is to improve our ability to make statistical inferences about hard-to-observe social and political phenomena. For the sake of brevity, this document focuses on my methodological agenda.\n\n\nThe last decade has seen considerable improvement in research transparency and registration. Recent advances in experimental design provide tools to diagnose the properties of a research design before data collection. For example, one can think about bias, power, or target sample size under different hypothetical data generation processes.\nA recurrent goal in statistics, econometrics, and political methodology is to minimize bias, or being close to the hypothetical truth on average. Instead, my agenda focuses on optimizing statistical precision, understood as producing consistent results after multiple realizations of the same data generation process. The literature implicitly assumes that one cam simply improve precision by increasing sample size. However, this is not feasible in most applications due to resource considerations.\nEven if resources are not an obstacle, even the least intrusive study wastes time and energy from researchers, administrators, and participants. This implies an ethical mandate to identify a research design that maximizes benefits and minimizes harm at the lowest possible cost. An emphasis on statistical precision allows researchers to anticipate and internalize these costs before implementation.\nFocusing on field and survey experiments, this agenda follows two strands. First, researchers often face the choice between alternative experimental designs for which unbiased estimators are already documented. In this case, opting for the design with more precision leads to unforeseen costs in other dimensions. Two projects exemplify how I develop standard to navigate this precision.\nIn a manuscript forthcoming in the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I propose statistical tests to address problems with double list experiments. Social scientists use list experiments in surveys when respondents may not answer truthfully to sensitive questions. When their assumptions are met, list experiments reduce sensitivity biases from misreporting. However, they tend to produce estimates with high variance, which prevents researchers from improving upon direct questioning. Double list experiments promise to remedy this by implementing two parallel list experiments and then aggregating their results, which roughly halves the variance of the estimate for the prevalence of the sensitive trait.\nThis implies an estimator that is more precise and still unbiased, but their implementation brings the question over whether the aggregation of the results of two parallel experiments yields a valid estimate. The tests leverage variation in the order in which respondents see the sensitive item to detect whether respondents are reacting to list experiment questions in unintended ways. This provides researchers with a tool to apply this underexplored variant of the technique more widely.\nIn a paper under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting research design features aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through implicit or explicit sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision. However, if this requires contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates first and then post-treatment outcomes, then it creates space for attrition that would not exist otherwise, which may offset the precision gains of blocking. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage.\nThe second reason to focus on statistical precision is that sometimes a more precise yet biased estimator gives more informative answers than an unbiased estimator, which is especially relevant for policy decision-makers. In this case, the researcher is explicitly sacrificing unbiasedness for the sake of precision. Two other projects reflect this issue.\nFirst, in work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet more precise estimators in the analysis of experimental data. Once again, an example of this trade-off comes from block-randomized experiments. Block-randomization entails grouping observations in groups or strata, conducting parallel experiments in each, and then calculating a single treatment effect with a weighted average. Previous work in statistics suggests that block-size weights lead to an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect in this setting. However, because experiments are expensive to implement, we illustrate situations under which researchers may prefer to sacrifice unbiasedness in favor of more precise estimates, which would lead to the use of precision weights instead, the equivalent of using fixed effects in OLS regression. We extend this idea to the use of M-estimator for data with skewed outcomes. We illustrate these ideas through simulation and by revisiting the design of a messaging field experiment conducted by the Office of Evaluation Sciences in the United States.\n\nSecond, in a chapter with Christopher Grady (USAID) and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois) in The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, we discuss the trend of increasingly more complex research designs in survey experimentation. For example, short vignettes are replaced with factorial experiments including many attributes. This increase in complexity allows researchers to isolate causal effects from potential confounders, but raises concerns over whether the tasks that respondents face in survey experiments tap into the intended construct outside of the survey framework. In other words, we draw attention to the trade-off between simple designs that risk confounding bias and complex designs that yield unbiased estimates but risk external validity bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the next five years, my goal is to establish a research group with the common goal of improving research design in the social sciences. The group will pursue two objectives. First, to continue developing new tools to improve research design before data collection, now expanding beyond experiments and quasi-experiments toward a broader set of cutting edge tools for statistical learning and inference. Second, to apply these tools across a broad range of substantive areas of interest, then use these programs as a motivation for further methodological innovation.\nCurrent work in progress serves as an example of this workflow. In work with Ines Fynn Universidad Católica del Uruguay), Verónica Pérez (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we implement the developments I have introduced to list experiments to document the extent of violent and non-violent criminal governance strategies in Montevideo, Uruguay. This is a context of high state presence and relatively low crime in the region, yet criminal organizations remain embedded in the territory through the use of these tools. Since measuring exposure to criminal governance involves trying to reach hidden populations through surveys, we spend considerable effort in applying new techniques to overcome potential sensitivity bias.\nIn addition to building upon my work on list experiments, we also implement questions based on the network-scale up method, a technique popular in the health sciences to measure the size of unobserved populations. We include multiple indirect questioning techniques for two reasons. First, these methods only produce valid estimates under restrictive assumptions, so one needs multiple approaches to satisfy different sources of skepticism. Second, since both list experiments and the network scale-up method produce estimates with high variance, we take this as an opportunity to further expand the range of tools available to measure sensitive attitudes and behaviors through surveys by showing how to combine estimates from these two techniques to improve our ability to produce consistent estimates.\nThe support and resources associated with a research group may allow me to direct long-term projects that continue to iterate between methodological innovation and its application to pressing social and political issues."

This approach also creates a set of communication rules that allows individual students to stay on task no matter how much their interests differ from the course content and provides the group with tools to manage instances of discrimination in the classroom and beyond.\nTo accomplish my objective, I design courses with two principles in mind.

I encourage the most generous definitions of “political” and “region”. This has led to reports that cover general elections in Germany, homelessness in Seattle, and the allocation of Mardi Gras parade routes.

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\n\n\nAs someone teaching quantitative methods to social science majors, I face the impossible task of conveying mathematical thinking, statistical programming, and their application to academia, policy, and industry to an audience in which the majority of individuals chose their degree to explicitly avoid these topics. Usually, my students start the semester with an appreciation for quantitative research, but find it impossible to produce their own output.\nMy approach to accomplish this within one semester is to unify all these elements as the task of acquiring a new language. A single course will not teach students everything they need to know to become fluent, but it can give enough tools to facilitate future learning in a direction that is beneficial to students with diverse backgrounds and career goals. For some, this may mean engaging directly with data or code. For others, the goal is to communicate productively with data analysts in a future workplace.\nTo accommodate this diversity, I design courses with two principles in mind. First, students need flexibility to engage with the course on their own terms and focus on the content they find useful. For example, the flipped classroom lab sessions in my course on data analysis for public opinion and policy asks students to evaluate a research design, suggest alternatives or modifications, and to evaluate its statistical properties through coding and writing. Some students may propose increasing the sample size, sampling from a different underlying population, or changing the assignment of treatment conditions. This allows students to pursue the tasks that suit their interests and gives me the freedom to reward creativity and effort over correctness.\nThe second principle is accountability, which is necessary to keep everyone on task while allowing flexibility. This means agreeing on an overarching theme that every single course activity must relate to. For example, early on my data analysis course, I introduce the bias-variance tradeoff as a principle to choose among alternative research designs. So, while students are free to propose any modification to an existing research design that they deem appropriate, they are also required to document the explicit or implicit costs that would come from their proposal. They must consider, for instance, that a representative sample is more expensive than a convenience sample, or that implementing a block-randomized experiment may require access to variables that cannot be measured easily.\nFlexibility and accountability also help in preventing instances of discrimination in the learning process. Through flexibility, students are invited to add value to the course by bringing their own perspective, knowledge, or experiences. In turn, accountability sets the scope for the type of contributions of interventions that are admissible.

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\n\n\nAs someone teaching quantitative methods to social science majors, I face the impossible task of conveying mathematical thinking, statistical programming, and their application to academia, policy, and industry to an audience in which the majority of individuals chose their degree to explicitly avoid these topics. Usually, my students start the semester with an appreciation for quantitative research, but find it impossible to produce their own output.\nMy approach to accomplish this within one semester is to unify all these elements as the task of acquiring a new language. A single course will not teach students everything they need to know to become fluent, but it can give enough tools to facilitate future learning in a direction that is beneficial to students with diverse backgrounds and career goals. For some, this may mean engaging directly with data or code. For others, the goal is to communicate productively with data analysts in a future workplace.\nTo accommodate this diversity, I design courses with two principles in mind. First, students need flexibility to engage with the course on their own terms and focus on the content they find useful. For example, the flipped classroom lab sessions in my course on data analysis for public opinion and policy asks students to evaluate a research design, suggest alternatives or modifications, and to evaluate its statistical properties through coding and writing. Some students may propose increasing the sample size, sampling from a different underlying population, or changing the assignment of treatment conditions.

My course on data analysis for public opinion and policy is designed to give students enough flexibility to connect statistical theory to their own interests and career goals.

    "text": "I write to express my interest in your call for an Assistant Teaching Professor. I am a postdoctoral fellow in Advanced Statistical, Causal Inference, and Computational Methodologies in the Department of Political Science at McMaster University. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Jake Bowers, Matt Winters, Gisela Sin, and Avital Livny.\nIs study the application of tools computational social science and design-based causal inference to improve research design in the social sciences. I apply these ideas to questions of accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South.\n\n\nI have experience teaching courses on quantitative methods and comparative politics. At McMaster, I teach data analysis for public policy and public opinion. At Tulane, I taught a seminar on evidence-informed policy to address social and political challenges in developing democracies. Both courses emphasize experimental and quasi-experimental designs for causal inference. At Illinois, I served as a teaching assistant for statistics courses at the undergraduate and PhD levels using a flipped classroom approach. I also served as a math camp instructor for incoming graduate students for three consecutive years. I also have experience teaching introduction to comparative politics in a hybrid format and an online course on the politics of developing countries.\nMy involvement beyond the classroom also complements my teaching and mentoring. My work as the methods editorial assistant for the American Political Science Review exposes me to cutting-edge methods in the field. As a PhD student at Illinois, I started a collaborative project in which graduate students introduced their peers to new methods and organized a reading group on computational social science methods.\nThese experiences have prepared me to teach to a diverse student body, to adapt to both online and in-person platforms, and to teach both the theory and application of quantitative methods.\n\n\n\nI am prepared to teach courses on methodology, research design, quantitative methods, computational social science, machine learning, evidence-informed policy, and the politics of the Global South. You can find copies of current and sample syllabi in my teaching portfolio. As a first-generation scholar, my teaching philosophy emphasizes using the language of the social sciences as a tool to advance the careers of students with different backgrounds and goals.\n\n\n\nMy research agenda focuses on developing tools that researchers can adopt to improve statistical precision before data collection. This is overlooked in the statistics, econometrics, and political methodology literature in favor of identifying unbiased estimators. Implicitly, this literature assumes that one can improve statistical precision by increasing sample size. This is not feasible in many social science applications due to resource limitations. Moreover, resource considerations aside, even the least intrusive study has an ethical mandate to identify a research design that maximizes benefits and minimizes harm at the lowest possible cost.\nFocusing on field and survey experiments, this agenda follows two strands. First, I examine cases where one can improve statistical precision without sacrificing unbiasedness, which implies unforeseen costs in other dimensions. For example, in work under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we show how implementing alternatives to the standard experimental design, such as pre-post outcome measurement or block randomization, may attenuate the expected gains in precision via explicit or implicit sample loss. In a solo-authored piece accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I introduce new tools to assess the validity of estimates in double list experiments. This is a variant of the list experiment that promises more precise results but comes with under-explored questionnaire design complications. In work in progress with Inés Fynn (Universidad Católica del Uruguay), Verónica Pérez Bentancur (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we show how to combine list experiments with network scale up questions to improve the precision of prevalence rate estimates for sensitive attitudes and behaviors at the cost one additional assumption.\nThe second strand focuses on cases where one can improve precision by sacrificing unbiasedness deliberately. For example, in work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet precise estimators to analyze experimental data, including applications to block-randomization and M-estimation. In a SAGE Handbook chapter with Christopher Grady and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois), we discuss the merits and challenges of increasingly complex survey experimental designs that improve precision at the cost of external validity bias.\n\nI believe my expertise makes me an excellent fit at UCSD. If you have any questions, you can contact me via email or phone.\nSincerely,\n\nGustavo Diaz\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nDepartment of Political Science\nMcMaster University"
