    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\nAs someone teaching statistics to social science majors, I face the impossible task of conveying mathematical thinking, statistical programming, and their application to academia, policy, and industry to an audience in which the majority of individuals chose their degree to explicitly avoid math. Usually, my students start the semester with an appreciation for statistical analysis, but find it impossible to produce their own output.\nMy approach to accomplish this within one semester is to unify all these elements as the task of acquiring a new language. A single course will not teach students everything they need to know to become fluent, but it can give enough tools to facilitate future learning in a direction that is beneficial to students with diverse backgrounds and career goals. For some, this may mean engaging directly with data or code. For others, the goal is to communicate productively with data analysts in a future workplace.\n\nTo accommodate this diversity, I design courses with two principles in mind. First, students need flexibility to engage with the course on their own terms and focus on the content they find useful. For example, the flipped classroom lab sessions in my course on data analysis for public opinion and policy asks students to evaluate a research design, suggest alternatives or modifications, and to evaluate its statistical properties through coding and writing. Some students may propose increasing the sample size, sampling from a different underlying population, or changing the assignment of treatment conditions. This allows students to pursue the tasks that suit their interests and gives me the freedom to reward creativity and effort over correctness.\nThe second principle is accountability, which is necessary to keep everyone on task while allowing flexibility. This means agreeing on an overarching theme that every single course activity must relate to. For example, early on my data analysis course, I introduce the bias-variance tradeoff as a principle to choose among alternative research designs. So, while students are free to propose any modification to an existing research design that they deem appropriate, they are also required to document the explicit or implicit costs that would come from their proposal. They must consider, for instance, that a representative sample is more expensive than a convenience sample, or that implementing a block-randomized experiment may require access to variables that cannot be measured easily.\nFlexibility and accountability also help in preventing instances of discrimination in the learning process. Through flexibility, students are invited to add value to the course by bringing their own perspective, knowledge, or experiences. In turn, accountability sets the scope for the type of contributions of interventions that are admissible. From this perspective, a racist remark is unacceptable not because someone disagrees with it, but because it is beyond the scope of the course vocabulary.\n\n\n\n\nI have experience statistics in the social sciences to diverse audiences and under different formats. At McMaster, I teach data analysis for public policy and public opinion, with emphasis on experimental and quasi-experimental designs for causal inference. The goal of this course is to give students hands-on experience in designing a quantitative research project in an area relevant to academia, policy, or industry.\nAt Tulane, I taught an undergrad senior course on the challenges of developing democracies from the perspective of evidence-informed policymaking. This course overviews how governments, researchers, and civil society organizations around the world use and produce data to understand and overcome the main challenges in the path to democratic consolidation around the world. The previous version focused primarily design-based causal inference. In a future version, I plan to expand toward the application of machine learning and data science in general.\nIn my time at Illinois, I taught statistics and research methods. In the 2020-2021 academic year, I was the graduate methods teaching assistant in our department. My duties involved advising PhD students taking courses in the quantitative methods sequence, as well as mentoring undergraduates enrolled in the senior honors thesis program. I also served as a teaching assistant for Jake Bowers’ introduction to data analysis for political science majors. This course focuses on flipped classroom learning, letting students engage with the course material on their own time and using lecture time to work as a group on problem sets and research projects. I have also contributed as a math camp instructor for three consecutive years, introducing statistical programming in R to incoming graduate students in our department.\nI also have experience teaching substantive social science courses using online and hybrid approaches. Topics include comparative government and the politics of developing countries. I am ready to apply these experiences in the development and delivery of statistics courses through online platforms.\nTeaching to these diverse audiences made me aware of the importance of promoting out-of classroom learning experiences. I organized a reading group on machine learning at Illinois that met regularly in the Summer and Fall of 2017. I started a a collaborative project in which graduate students share cheatsheets introducing their fellows to new statistical tools. I have also enjoyed the experience of mentoring an undergraduate research assistant, using the opportunity to help both of us learn big data for text analysis. In the future, I plan to facilitate and institutionalize similar learning experiences in every aspect of my work.\n\n\n\nI am prepared to teach courses on statistical inference, statistical programming, causal inference, design of experiments, machine learning, and their application to social science and public policy.

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \nPolitical scientists often study phenomena that cannot be observed directly. For example, we use responses to hypothetical survey questions to infer actual behavior, we resort to aggregate election results to understand individual evaluations of politicians’ performance in office, and we conduct randomized controlled trials in some places to determine if a policy is advisable in other places. Doing this credibly requires creativity in research design, as researchers must try to anticipate the challenges to inference even before conducting data analysis.\nMy research develops standards to navigate the tradeoffs that emerge when one considers research design alternatives before data collection. I use tools from computational social science to identify practices and procedures that researchers can adopt to improve how they approach data at the pre-analysis stage. My current agenda focuses on the design of field and survey experiments. In the future, I plan to expand to causal inference in quasi-experiments and observational studies.\nI apply the insights of my methodological work to questions around the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation. The common theme in these applications is to improve our ability to make statistical inferences about hard-to-observe social and political phenomena. For the sake of brevity, this document focuses on my methodological agenda.\n\n\nThe last decade has seen considerable improvement in research transparency and registration. Recent advances in experimental design provide tools to diagnose the properties of a research design before data collection. For example, one can think about bias, power, or target sample size under different hypothetical data generation processes.\nA recurrent goal in statistics, econometrics, and political methodology is to minimize bias, or being close to the hypothetical truth on average. Instead, my agenda focuses on optimizing statistical precision, understood as producing consistent results after multiple realizations of the same data generation process. The literature implicitly assumes that one cam simply improve precision by increasing sample size. However, this is not feasible in most applications due to resource considerations.\nEven if resources are not an obstacle, even the least intrusive study wastes time and energy from researchers, administrators, and participants. This implies an ethical mandate to identify a research design that maximizes benefits and minimizes harm at the lowest possible cost. An emphasis on statistical precision allows researchers to anticipate and internalize these costs before implementation.\nFocusing on field and survey experiments, this agenda follows two strands. First, researchers often face the choice between alternative experimental designs for which unbiased estimators are already documented. In this case, opting for the design with more precision leads to unforeseen costs in other dimensions. Two projects exemplify how I develop standard to navigate this precision.\nIn a manuscript forthcoming in the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I propose statistical tests to address problems with double list experiments. Social scientists use list experiments in surveys when respondents may not answer truthfully to sensitive questions. When their assumptions are met, list experiments reduce sensitivity biases from misreporting. However, they tend to produce estimates with high variance, which prevents researchers from improving upon direct questioning. Double list experiments promise to remedy this by implementing two parallel list experiments and then aggregating their results, which roughly halves the variance of the estimate for the prevalence of the sensitive trait.\nThis implies an estimator that is more precise and still unbiased, but their implementation brings the question over whether the aggregation of the results of two parallel experiments yields a valid estimate. The tests leverage variation in the order in which respondents see the sensitive item to detect whether respondents are reacting to list experiment questions in unintended ways. This provides researchers with a tool to apply this underexplored variant of the technique more widely.\nIn a paper under revise and resubmit at te American Political Science Review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting research design features aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through implicit or explicit sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision. However, if this requires contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates first and then post-treatment outcomes, then it creates space for attrition that would not exist otherwise, which may offset the precision gains of blocking. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage.\nThe second reason to focus on statistical precision is that sometimes a more precise yet biased estimator gives more informative answers than an unbiased estimator, which is especially relevant for policy decision-makers. In this case, the researcher is explicitly sacrificing unbiasedness for the sake of precision. Two other projects reflect this issue.\nFirst, in work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet more precise estimators in the analysis of experimental data. Once again, an example of this trade-off comes from block-randomized experiments. Block-randomization entails grouping observations in groups or strata, conducting parallel experiments in each, and then calculating a single treatment effect with a weighted average. Previous work in statistics suggests that block-size weights lead to an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect in this setting. However, because experiments are expensive to implement, we illustrate situations under which researchers may prefer to sacrifice unbiasedness in favor of more precise estimates, which would lead to the use of precision weights instead, the equivalent of using fixed effects in OLS regression. We extend this idea to the use of M-estimator for data with skewed outcomes. We illustrate these ideas through simulation and by revisiting the design of a messaging field experiment conducted by the Office of Evaluation Sciences in the United States.\n\nSecond, in a chapter with Christopher Grady (USAID) and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois) in The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, we discuss the trend of increasingly more complex research designs in survey experimentation. For example, short vignettes are replaced with factorial experiments including many attributes. This increase in complexity allows researchers to isolate causal effects from potential confounders, but raises concerns over whether the tasks that respondents face in survey experiments tap into the intended construct outside of the survey framework. In other words, we draw attention to the trade-off between simple designs that risk confounding bias and complex designs that yield unbiased estimates but risk external validity bias.\n\n\n\n\nI plan to use the insights of my work to inform applications around my substantive areas of interest. In turn, I aim to use applications as a motivation for further methodological innovation.\nFor example, in work in progress with with Inés Fynn (Universidad Católica del Uruguay), Verónica Pérez (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we apply my work on list experiments to document the extent of negative and positive criminal governance strategies in Montevideo, Uruguay. This project also develops techniques to combine prevalence estimates from list experiments with network scale-up questions, a technique more common in the health sciences. This expands the range of tools available to measure sensitive attitudes and behaviors through surveys.\n\nI also plan to expand my research program toward the use of data science tools to improve statistical inference. An early example comes from my dissertation work on the effect of investigating the use of federal funds among selected mayors in Brazil on the behavior of other mayors in nearby localities. My theory suggests geographic spillovers as a quantity of interest, yet it gives no guidelines for how far away that effect would travel. This presents a tradeoff between operationalizations that introduce bias by being too narrow or too broad. I overcame this problem using a penalized regression framework to choose the optimal upper bound. This innovation received the best poster award in the 2019 Latin American Political Methodology meeting."

    "text": "Je vous écris à propos de votre annonce pour un poste de professeur en analyse computationnelle des données politiques. Actuellement, je suis stagiaire postdoctorale en méthodologies statistiques avancées, analyse causale, et sciences des données au département de science politique à l’Université McMaster. J’ai obtenu mon doctorat (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) sous la direction de Jake Bowers, Matt Winters, Gisela Sin et Avital Livny.\nJe recherche le développement des critères pour naviguer les compromis liés à la conception de recherche en sciences sociales, avec l’accent mis sur les sciences sociales computationnelles et l’analyse causale. J’applique ces idées aux questions de gouvernance et représentation dans le Sud global. Mes travaux sont publiés dans revues et volumes telles que World Development, le Journal of Experimental Political Science et le SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations. J’ai aussi un travail en revise and resubmit dans le British Journal of Political Science.\nMon programme de recherche se concentre sur le développement d’outils qu’on peut adopter pour améliorer la précision statistique avant la collecte de données. Cette dimension est souvent négligée dans la littérature en statistiques, en économétrie et en méthodologie politique, au profit de l’identification d’estimateurs non biaisés. Implicitement, cette littérature suppose qu’on peut améliorer la précision en augmentant la taille de l’échantillon. Cela n’est pas possible dans les applications habituelles en science politique en raison de contraintes de ressources. En plus, même l’étude la moins intrusive a un mandat d’identifier une conception de recherche qui maximise les avantages et minimise les préjudices au coût le plus bas.\nCet agenda suit deux lignes de recherche, avec l’accent mis sur les essais contrôlés aléatoires. Premièrement, j’examine comme on peut améliorer la précision statistique sans introduire de biais, ce qui implique des coûts imprévus en autres dimensions. Par exemple, dans un travail en révision avec Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), nous étudions comment des techniques telles que la randomisation par blocs et les pre-post designs, initialement conçues pour améliorer la précision, peuvent atténuer les gains de précision en réduisant la taille de l’échantillon. Dans un article du Journal of Experimental Political Science, j’introduis nouveaux outils pour évaluer la validité des estimations dans les double list experiments. Il s’agit d’une variante du list experiment qui promet des résultats plus précis mais présente des complications sous-explorées dans la conception du questionnaire. Dans un travail en cours avec Inés Fynn (Universidad Católica del Uruguay), Verónica Pérez Bentancur (Universidad de la República) et Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), nous combinons le list experiment avec des questions du network scale-up method pour améliorer la précision des estimations des attitudes sensibles au prix d’un postulat supplémentaire.\nDeuxièmement, j’étude les situations dans lesquelles on peut améliorer la précision en introduisant de biais intentionnellement. Par exemple, dans un travail en cours avec Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), nous discutons les circonstances dans lesquelles on devraient privilégier des estimateurs biaisés mais précis en l’analyse des données expérimentales, avec applications sur la randomisation par blocs et les M-estimateurs. Dans un SAGE Handbook chapitre avec Christopher Grady et Jim Kuklinski (Illinois), nous discutons des mérites et défis des expériences dans enquêtes qui deviennent de plus en plus complexes. Cela se traduit par une amélioration de la précision au prix du biais de validité externe.\nMon expérience d’enseignement comprend des cours sur les méthodes quantitatives et en politique comparée. À McMaster, j’enseigne l’analyse de données pour les politiques publiques et l’opinion publique. À l’université Tulane, j’ai enseigné les politiques basées sur des preuves dans les démocraties en développement. Ces deux cours mettent l’accent sur l’analyse causale, et j’ai l’intention de les élargir pour inclure applications sur l’apprentissage automatique et la science des données. En Illinois, j’ai été auxiliaire d’enseignement en l’analyse des données au niveau du baccalauréat et doctorat avec une modèle de classe inversée. J’ai également enseigné dans le math-camp pendant trois années consécutives. J’ai aussi l’expérience d’enseigner l’introduction à la politique comparée en format hybride et la politique des pays en développement en ligne.\nMa participation extracurriculaire contribue également à mon enseignement. En tant que assistant éditorial en méthodologie pour l’American Political Science Review, j’ai l’opportunité de influencer le développement des méthodes avancés dans la discipline. En tant que doctorant en Illinois, j’ai initié un projet collaboratif dans lequel les doctorants introduit nouvelles méthodes à leurs pairs et j’ai organisé un groupe de lecture sur les sciences sociales computationnelles.\nJe suis prêt à enseigner des cours sur la statistique, la programmation statistique, l’analyse causale, les sciences sociales computationnelles, l’apprentissage automatique, ainsi que leur application aux politiques basées sur des preuves. Vous pouvez trouver des exemplaires des programmes dans mon site web.\nJe crois que mon expertise me rend bien adapté à l’Université Laval. J’ai l’expérience d’avoir étudié dans une institution francophone. Ce qui signifie que je peux m’engager à l’enseignement conformément à la politique linguistique dans les délais impartis. N’hésitez pas à me contacter si vous avez des questions.\nCordialement,\n\nGustavo Diaz\nPostdoctoral Fellow\n McMaster University"

    "text": "I write to express my interest in your call for an Assistant Professor in Statistics. I am a postdoctoral fellow in Advanced Statistical, Causal Inference, and Computational Methodologies in the Department of Political Science at McMaster University. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Jake Bowers, Matt Winters, Gisela Sin, and Avital Livny.\nMy research uses tools from machine learning and design-based causal inference to develop standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in the social sciences. I focus on applications in which human behavior prevents us from observing the phenomena we wish to understand directly, thus demanding creativity in data analysis. My work is published, forthcoming, or under revise and resubmit in leading social science outlets discussing these topics, including the British Journal of Political Science, World Development, and the Journal of Experimental Political Science.\n\n\n\nMy research agenda focuses on developing tools that researchers can adopt to improve statistical precision before data collection. This is overlooked in the causal inference literature in favor of identifying unbiased estimators. Implicitly, this literature assumes that one can improve statistical precision by increasing sample size. This is not feasible in many social science applications due to resource limitations. Moreover, resource considerations aside, even the least intrusive study has an ethical mandate to identify a research design that maximizes benefits and minimizes harm at the lowest possible cost.\nFocusing on randomized controlled trials, this agenda follows two strands. First, I examine cases where one can improve statistical precision without sacrificing unbiasedness, which implies unforeseen costs in other dimensions. For example, in work under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we show how implementing alternatives to the standard experimental design, such as pre-post outcome measurement or block randomization, may attenuate the expected gains in precision via explicit or implicit sample loss. In a solo-authored piece accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I introduce new tools to assess the validity of estimates in double list experiments. This is a variant of the list experiment that promises more precise results but comes with under-explored questionnaire design complications. In work in progress with Inés Fynn (PUC-Chile), Verónica Pérez Bentancur (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we show how to combine list experiments with network scale up questions to improve the precision of prevalence rate estimates for sensitive attitudes and behaviors at the cost one additional assumption.\nThe second strand focuses on cases where one can improve precision by sacrificing unbiasedness deliberately. For example, in work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet precise estimators to analyze experimental data, including applications to block-randomization and M-estimation. In a SAGE Handbook chapter with Christopher Grady and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois), we discuss the merits and challenges of increasingly complex survey experimental designs that improve precision at the cost of external validity bias.\n\n\nI plan to expand my research program toward the use of machine learning to improve statistical inference. An early example comes from my dissertation work, funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian Studies, on the effect of investigating the use of federal funds among selected mayors in Brazil on the behavior of other mayors in nearby localities. My theory suggests geographic spillovers as a quantity of interest, yet it gives no guidelines for how far away that effect would travel. This presents a tradeoff between operationalizations that introduce bias by being too narrow or too broad. I overcame this problem using a penalized regression framework to choose the optimal upper bound. This innovation received the best poster award in the 2019 Latin American Political Methodology meeting.\n\n\nMy teaching focuses on making applied statistics accessible to diverse audiences through a combination of flexibility and accountability. At McMaster, I teach data analysis for public policy and public opinion. At Tulane, I taught a seminar on the use of design-based causal inference to address social and political challenges in developing democracies. At Illinois, I served as a teaching assistant for statistics courses at the undergraduate and PhD levels using a flipped classroom approach. I also served as a math camp instructor for incoming graduate students for three consecutive years. I also have experience teaching political science courses in online and hybrid formats.\nMy involvement beyond the classroom also complements my teaching and mentoring. My work as the methods editorial assistant for the American Political Science Review gives me the opportunity to shape and influence the development and application of cutting-edge statistical methods in the social sciences. As a PhD student at Illinois, I started a collaborative project in which graduate students introduced their peers to new methods and organized a reading group on data science.\n\n\n\nI am prepared to teach courses on statistical inference, statistical programming, causal inference, design of experiments, machine learning, and their application to social science and public policy. You can find copies of current and sample syllabi in my website.\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe my expertise makes me an excellent fit at Binghamton University.

I specialize in comparative politics and quantitative methods. I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Jake Bowers, Matt Winters, Gisela Sin, and Avital Livny.\n\n\nSubstantively, I research the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South from the a political behavior perspective. Methodologically, I use tools from causal inference and computational social science to develop standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in quantitative studies. My work is published in outlets including World Development and the Journal of Experimental Political Science. My work is also under revise and resubmit at the British Journal of Political Science.\n\n\n\nMy primary agenda stems from an original data collection effort in Brazil, combining text analysis and machine learning to construct the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions at the local level. This dataset informs several of my ongoing research programs. The first project focuses on the unintended electoral consequences of investigating corruption, with emphasis on how politicians’ informational advantage allows them to undertake preemptive behavior to ward off negative reactions from the public. For example, in a piece under review, I show how mayors with reelection incentives decrease public spending in reaction to being randomly selected for an audit of their use of federal funds. This suggests an attempt to minimize the potential irregularities that audits may uncover.\nIn another solo-authored working paper, I argue that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing. I show that corruption revelation drives mayors in nearby municipalities to switch parties more often in an effort to secure a better platform for reelection. When politicians are not investigated for corruption themselves but still expect increased scrutiny in their performance, this behavior is more cost-effective than working to improve performance in office.\n\nThe second research program focuses on the gendered electoral consequences of investigating corruption. In a book chapter with Kelly Senters Piazza (US Air Force Academy), we use my corruption infractions dataset to show how corruption revelation increases the proportion of female candidates running for mayor, but not their chances of winning elections. We attribute this to incumbents’ incentives to counter the rise of female politicians. In another forthcoming book chapter in a separate volume, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of different data sources to study gender and corruption.\nThis program has evolved toward the gendered evaluations of officeholders’ performance in general. In a piece in World Development, we discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to promote female political representation through increased discontent with the performance of male-led executives and by priming a health policy issue commonly associated with women. In work under revise and resubmit at the British Journal of Political Science with Virginia Oliveros (Tulane), Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro (Brown), and Matt Winters (Illinois), we use a survey experiment in Argentina to show gendered differential reactions to policy implementation performance.\n\n\nThis research agenda has also led me to produce methodological work to improve our ability to detect hard-to-observe social and political phenomena. I focus on how scholars can navigate research design tradeoffs before data collection. For example, in an article accepted at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I introduce new tools to assess the validity of estimates in double list experiments. This is a variant of the list experiment that promises more precise results but comes with under-explored questionnaire design complications. My expertise in this subject has led collaborations on topics ranging from support to same-sex marriage in Argentina to criminal governance in Uruguay.\n\nMy experience as a methodology and area studies postdoc at two separate institutions has given me the opportunity to teach courses in comparative politics and quantitative methods. At McMaster, I teach data analysis for public opinion and public policy. At Tulane, I taught introduction comparative politics and a senior seminar on the challenges of developing democracies from an evidence-based policy perspective. My work as the methods editorial assistant for the American Political Science Review also puts me in a unique position to gain exposure to the most current methods in the field, awareness of which I can incorporate into my teaching and mentoring.\nAs a graduate student at Illinois, I taught an online course on the politics of developing countries as an independent instructor and served as a teaching assistant for its in-person version. I also served as a teaching assistant for quantitative research methods courses at the undergraduate and PhD levels using a flipped classroom approach. These experiences have prepared me to teach to a diverse student body and to adapt to both online and in-person platforms.\n\n\n\nI am prepared to teach courses on comparative politics, comparative political behavior, democracy and representation, research design, and quantitative methods. You can find copies of current and sample syllabi in my teaching portfolio. As a first-generation scholar, my teaching philosophy emphasizes building flexible learning environments for students with different backgrounds and career goals.\n\nI believe my expertise makes me an excellent fit at the ICP.

I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Jake Bowers, Matt Winters, Gisela Sin, and Avital Livny.\nI study and teach the application tools from design-based causal inference to develop standards to improve research design in the social sciences. I focus on applications in which human behavior prevents us from observing the phenomena we wish to understand directly, thus demanding creativity in data analysis.\n\n\nI have experience teaching courses on quantitative methods and their application to policy. At McMaster, I teach data analysis for public policy and public opinion. At Tulane, I taught a seminar on evidence-informed policy to address social and political challenges in developing democracies. Both courses emphasize the value of statistics in making credible policy recommendations. At Illinois, I served as a teaching assistant for statistics courses at the undergraduate and PhD levels using a flipped classroom approach. I also served as a math camp instructor for incoming graduate students for three consecutive years. I also have experience teaching political science courses in online and hybrid formats.\nMy involvement beyond the classroom also complements my teaching and mentoring. My work as the methods editorial assistant for the American Political Science Review exposes me to cutting-edge statistical applications in the social sciences. As a PhD student at Illinois, I started a collaborative project in which graduate students introduced their peers to new methods and organized a reading group on data science.\nThese experiences have prepared me to teach to a diverse student body, to adapt to both online and in-person platforms, and to teach both the theory and application of statistics.\n\n\n\nI am prepared to teach courses on statistical inference, statistical programming, causal inference, data science, machine learning, and applications to evidence-informed policy around the globe. You can find copies of current and sample syllabi in my website. As a first-generation scholar, my teaching philosophy emphasizes using the language of statistics as a tool to advance the careers of students with different backgrounds and goals.\n\n\n\nMy research agenda focuses on developing tools that researchers can adopt to improve statistical precision before data collection. This is overlooked in the causal inference literature in favor of identifying unbiased estimators. Implicitly, this literature assumes that one can improve statistical precision by increasing sample size. This is not feasible in many social science applications due to resource limitations. Moreover, resource considerations aside, even the least intrusive study has an ethical mandate to identify a research design that maximizes benefits and minimizes harm at the lowest possible cost.\nFocusing on randomized controlled trials, this agenda follows two strands. First, I examine cases where one can improve statistical precision without sacrificing unbiasedness, which implies unforeseen costs in other dimensions. For example, in work under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we show how implementing alternatives to the standard experimental design, such as pre-post outcome measurement or block randomization, may attenuate the expected gains in precision via explicit or implicit sample loss. In a solo-authored article published at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I introduce new tools to assess the validity of estimates in double list experiments. This is a variant of the list experiment that promises more precise results but comes with under-explored questionnaire design complications. In work in progress with Inés Fynn (PUC-Chile), Verónica Pérez Bentancur (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we show how to combine list experiments with network scale up questions to improve the precision of prevalence rate estimates for sensitive attitudes and behaviors at the cost one additional assumption.\nThe second strand focuses on cases where one can improve precision by sacrificing unbiasedness deliberately. For example, in work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet precise estimators to analyze experimental data, including applications to block-randomization and M-estimation. In a SAGE Handbook chapter with Christopher Grady and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois), we discuss the merits and challenges of increasingly complex survey experimental designs that improve precision at the cost of external validity bias.\n\nI believe my expertise makes me an excellent fit at the University of Chicago. If you have any questions, you can contact me via email or phone.\nSincerely,\n\nGustavo Diaz\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nDepartment of Political Science\nMcMaster University"

    "title": "Revealed Corruption and Electoral Accountability in Brazil: How Politicians Anticipate Voting Behavior",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Governments, civil society organizations, and scholars spend considerable resources implementing and evaluating the effect of anti-corruption interventions. However, decades of cumulative evidence suggest that these interventions rarely lead to the removal of corrupt elected offcials from their positions. A recent interpretation of this gap suggests that corrupt politicians often go unpunished because they react to the knowledge of themselves or others being investigated for corruption in unanticipated ways. This dissertation uses data from a long-running anti-corruption program in Brazil to expand on the unintended consequences of anti-corruption interventions that stem from politicians’ strategic behavior. The first chapter shows that mayors randomly selected for auditing in the context of this program reduce public spending, particularly in highly visible budget categories, in years close to an election. I argue that this happens because mayors attempt to preserve their reelection chances by signaling fiscal responsibility. The second chapter shows how mayors that are not directly audited, but are in municipalities close to those with mayors exposed as corrupt, tend to seek reelection under different parties more often. As previous accounts of party switching in Brazil suggest, I argue that this occurs because incumbent politicians expect their constituency to react to the news of nearby corruption with increased scrutiny on their own performance in office, which in turn leads them to switch parties in an attempt to secure a better platform for reelection. The question of the effect of exposure to information about nearby corruption opens the door to a broader methodological question of how to capture this type of effect, which is the focus of the third chapter. Research questions in the social sciences usually suggest spillover or interference effects, but rarely provide guidelines on how to model those effects. In fact, theory often suggests many different plausible operationalizations along the same hypothetical pathway. To overcome this difficulty, I propose and illustrate the properties of a model selection approach that uses tools from supervised machine learning to select among alternative operationalizations. As a whole, this dissertation makes two key contributions. First, it shows how politicians’ reaction to anti-corruption interventions can stem from an attempt to avoid electoral accountability. Second, by proposing a model selection approach to interference, it expands the applicability of current tools to analyze interference effects to a broader set of research questions."

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\n\nSocial scientists often study phenomena that cannot be observed directly. For example, we use responses to hypothetical survey questions to infer actual behavior, we resort to aggregate election results to understand individual evaluations of politicians’ performance in office, and we conduct randomized controlled trials in some places to determine if a policy is advisable in other places. Doing this credibly requires creativity in research design, as researchers must try to anticipate challenges to inference even before conducting data analysis.\nMy research develops standards to navigate the tradeoffs that emerge when one considers research design alternatives before data collection. I use tools from computational social science and design-based causal inference to identify practices and procedures that researchers can adopt to improve how they approach data at the pre-analysis stage.\nMy current agenda focuses on the design of field and survey experiments. For example, in a paper under R&R at te American Political Science Review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting research design features aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through implicit or explicit sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision. However, if this requires contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates first and then post-treatment outcomes, then it creates space for attrition that would not exist otherwise, which may offset the precision gains of blocking. Against this notion, we show that alternative designs can improve precision even under non-neglible sample loss rates.\nAs another example, in a manuscript recently published in the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I propose statistical tests to address problems with double list experiments. This is a variant of the standard list experiment that promises more precision in the estimation of sensitive attitudes and behavior while preserving unbiasedness. However, their implementation brings additional questionnaire design complications that prevent researchers from adopting them as standard practice. The tests leverage variation in the order in which respondents see the sensitive item to detect whether respondents are reacting to list experiment questions in unintended ways. This provides researchers with a tool to apply this underexplored variant of the list experiment more widely.\nIn the future, I plan to expand this research program in two directions. First, I plan to use the insights of my work to inform applications that answer relevant questions on evidence-informed policy in the Americas and beyond.\nFor example, in a piece under R&R at the British Journal of Political Science with Virginia Oliveros (Tulane), Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro (Brown), and Matt Winters (Illinois), we use a survey experiment in Argentina to study gendered differential reactions to policy implementation. Previous work suggests that women face higher scrutiny for their performance in office However, in the context of the implementation of a food distribution program, we find that voters are only responsive to performance information (positive or negative) among male officeholders and tend to ignore performance information when told that an officeholder is a woman. We attribute this result to voters’ perception of male politicians as the default category, thus providing no new information on top of performance. In turn, mentioning the gender of a female politician leads voters to believe that good performance stems from factors beyond the incumbent’s control.\nI also aim to use substantive applications as a motivation for further methodological innovation. For example, in work in progress with with Inés Fynn (Universidad Católica del Uruguay), Verónica Pérez (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we apply my work on list experiments to document the extent of negative and positive criminal governance strategies in Uruguay. This project also develops techniques to combine prevalence estimates from list experiments with network scale-up questions, a technique more common in the health sciences. This expands the range of tools available to measure sensitive attitudes and behaviors through surveys.\nAs a second direction, I plan to expand towards the use of data science tools to improve statistical inference. An early example comes from my dissertation work on the effect of investigating the use of federal funds among selected mayors in Brazil on the behavior of other mayors in nearby localities. My theory suggests geographic spillovers as a quantity of interest, yet it gives no guidelines for how far away that effect would travel. This presents a tradeoff between operationalizations that introduce bias by being too narrow or too broad. I overcame this problem using a penalized regression framework to choose the optimal upper bound. This innovation received the best poster award in the 2019 Latin American Political Methodology meeting.\n\n\n\nAs someone teaching quantitative methods to social science, I face the impossible task of conveying mathematical thinking, statistical programming, and their application to academia and decision-making to an audience in which the majority of individuals chose their degree to explicitly avoid these topics. Usually, my students start the semester with an appreciation for quantitative research, but find it impossible to produce their own output.\nMy approach to accomplish this within one semester is to design courses as language-acquisition tasks under two guiding principles. First, students need flexibility to engage with the course on their own terms and focus on the content they find useful. For example, in the current iteration of my course on research design and data analysis for public opinion and policy, I have introduced contract grading to reward effort over correctness and allow students to work as much as they need to get the grade they want. In my course, students are presented with a baseline grading contract that guarantees a B+ as long as students complete assignments and requirements in a satisfactory and timely manner, with clear rules on what would decrease or improve their grade.\nThe second principle is accountability, which is necessary to keep everyone on task while allowing flexibility. This means agreeing on an overarching theme that every single course activity must relate to, which in turn informs what can be considered as a satisfactory level of effort. For example, early on in my course, I introduce the bias-variance tradeoff as a principle to choose among alternative research designs. So, while students are free to explore any modification to an existing research design that they deem appropriate, they are required to discuss its consequences under this framework. They must consider, for instance, that a representative sample is more expensive than a convenience sample, or that implementing a block-randomized experiment may require access to variables that cannot be measured easily.\nFlexibility and accountability also help in preventing instances of discrimination in the learning process. Through flexibility, students are invited to add value to the course by bringing their own perspective, knowledge, or experiences. In turn, accountability sets the scope for the type of contributions of interventions that are admissible. From this perspective, a discriminatory or harmful remark is unacceptable not because of potential ideological disagreement, but because it is beyond the scope of the vocabulary that our course aims to build.\nIn the future, I plan to expand upon this flexibility-accountability framework by incorporating flipped classroom approaches. With enough resources to record high-quality teaching material ahead of time, I can expand the scope of flexibility from assignment production toward the consumption of course material as a whole. This also enhances accountability by creating additional time to discuss norms and expectations around language-building.\n\n\n\nAs a first generation-scholar who initially chose to major in Political Science to avoid math and then became a political methodologist, I recognize that the conventional university setting may not allow individuals from non-traditional backgrounds to thrive. Therefore, my goal is to engage in service tasks that create opportunities to reduce entry barriers to knowledge generation and dissemination.\nMy initial efforts focused on facilitating out-of-classroom learning opportunities. During my PhD at Illinois, I started a methods cheatsheets project in 2018. In this project, volunteer graduate students write a short introduction to the theory, implementation, and current debates surrounding a technique of their expertise. These resources are shared in a repository available for current and future generations. I also organized a reading group on computational social science to provide a low-stakes space for individuals to read and discuss about methods that are not covered in the core methodological training.\nIn the future, I aim to translate these ideas into a sustainable and inclusive research program. I believe this is best accomplished by joining or creating a laboratory or working group around the topic of research methods for international affairs. This framework creates a space to foster dialogue across backgrounds, disciplines, and career stages, while also providing a safety net to provide early support to those who may otherwise struggle."

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\n\nAccording to Freedom House, 2022 marks the 17th consecutive year with available data in which the number of countries where democracy deteriorated outnumbers the number of countries where democracy improved. This trend emerges after several decades of continuous democratization and highlights the difficult path that separates democratization and consolidation.\nThis period is also marked by redoubled efforts by scholars, governments, and civil society organizations to identify and overcome the challenges to democracy around the world. Progress in research transparency and registration has lead to more coordinated efforts to produce credible evidence to determine what works, where, and why.\nMy research focuses on the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South, with regional focus in Latin America. The common theme across these topics is a concern on how strategic behavior from both citizens and politicians precludes accurate measurement and the identification of successful interventions. My main agenda analyzes the unintended electoral consequences of investigating and exposing corruption, and has evolved to focus on the gendered patterns in citizens’ evaluation of politicians’ performance in office.\nGiven the focus on hard-to-observe phenomena, this substantive agenda also informs a methodological program on the application of tools from causal inference and computational social science to navigate research design trade-offs before data collection in quantitative studies. My expertise in these topic has also spurred collaborations in the fields of gender and politics and crime and political violence.\n\n\n\nThe literature in political science and economics on electoral accountability highlights voters’ adverse selection problem: They prefer to have good over bad elected officials but they can only infer an incumbent’s type through observable outputs of their performance. Therefore, corrupt incumbents have incentives to hide illicit activities and appear good. To fight corruption, governments, civil society organizations, and scholars devote considerable resources to implementing and evaluating anti-corruption interventions that attempt to bridge the information gap between voters and politicians’ performance in office. However, the cumulative evidence suggests that these interventions rarely translate into voters sanctioning corrupt incumbents.\nA recent explanation for the lack of electoral sanctions is that politicians undertake preemptive behavior to ward off the negative consequences of corruption. For example, previous research shows that political parties avoid nominating legislators investigated for corruption to reelection. On the other side of the coin, research also shows that local level elected officials switch away from parties investigated for corruption after securing reelection. In short, politicians avoid direct association with corruption.\nPrevious research on electoral accountability shows that politicians try to minimize the electoral consequences of investigating and exposing corruption. I expand on this research in work funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian studies at the University of Illinois, using data from a long-running anti-corruption program in Brazil that randomly selects municipalities to audit their use of federal funds, and combining text analysis and machine learning to create the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions to date. I make two contributions to the literature.\nFirst, in a working paper, I argue that the main reason why politicians update their behavior in reaction to increased monitoring is because they expect increased scrutiny from their constituents. This contrasts from previous work suggesting that the primary incentive is top-down enforcement. I show that being selected for auditing leads mayors to shift public spending in a attempt to minimize the chances of uncovering irregularities. Mayors selected for auditing spend less when they are eligible for reelection and when the audits are announced close to an election year. This runs counter to previous evidence in political business cycles, which suggests that heightened electoral concerns lead to an increase in public spending.\nIn another working paper, I argue that politicians are also responsive to revealed corruption even when they are not directly connected to it. Whereas previous literature has shown evidence that partisans might react strategically to anticipated sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, I argue that this behavior is even more widespread and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing. This occurs because officeholders expect their constituencies to receive the news of corruption in nearby localities and react with increased scrutiny on their performance. I show that mayors in municipalities exposed to nearby corruption are more likely to seek reelection under a different party, and that they do so in a pattern that suggests an attempt to secure more resources for reelection.\n\n\n\nIn work with Kelly Senters Piazza (US Air Force Academy), we expand this agenda toward the gendered patterns that underlie how voters evaluate politicians’ performance in office in light of corruption. In a forthcoming book chapter in Norms, Gender and Corruption: Understanding the Nexus, we use my data on corruption infractions at the local level in Brazil to revisit previous findings on the gendered electoral consequences of corruption. Previous work in this topic uses public opinion data and survey experiments to show how revealing corruption increases support for female representation, yet also how female politicians face harsher sanctions for comparable levels of wrongdoing. We show that revealing corruption increases support for female representation in the form of an increased proportion of female candidates running for mayor, yet this support does not translate into an increased proportion of women winning elections, which we attribute to incumbent mayors’ incentives to counter the rise of female challengers.\nThis program extends to the study of gendered performance evaluations beyond corruption. In a piece in World Development, we highlight how exceptional events, such as corruption, conflict, and public health disasters, can promote female political representation by raising questions around the ability of male leadership to handle crises, as well as priming voters about issues around which women are perceived to have policy expertise. Examining public opinion data and recent media coverage around the world, we argue for the presence of both mechanisms in the COVID-19 global pandemic, implying a potential surge in female political representation.\nIn work under revise and resubmit at the British Journal of Political Science with Virginia Oliveros (Tulane), Rebecca Weitz-Shapiro (Brown), and Matt Winters (Illinois), we use a survey experiment in Argentina to study gendered differential reactions to policy implementation. Previous work suggests that women face higher scrutiny for their performance in office However, in the context of the implementation of a food distribution program, we find that voters are only responsive to performance information (positive or negative) among male officeholders and tend to ignore performance information when told that an officeholder is a woman. We attribute this result to voters’ perception of male politicians as the default category, thus providing no new information on top of performance. In turn, mentioning the gender of a female politician leads voters to believe that good performance stems from factors beyond the incumbent’s control.\n\n\n\nThe focus on the strategic elements of performance evaluations in my work has led me to contribute to the development of tools to improve our ability to detect or measure hard-to-observe social and political phenomena. This agenda currently focuses on survey and field experiments. In the future, I plan expand toward quasi-experiments and observational studies.\nFor example, in a manuscript recently published at the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I revisit double list experiments. Social scientists use list experiments in surveys when respondents may conceal their answer to sensitive questions. When their assumptions are met, list experiments reduce sensitivity biases from misreporting. However, they tend to produce estimates with high variance, which prevents researchers from improving upon direct questioning. Double list experiments promise to remedy this by implementing two parallel list experiments and then aggregating their results, which roughly halves the variance of the estimate for the prevalence of the sensitive trait. This implies an estimator that is more precise and still unbiased, but their implementation brings the question over whether the aggregation of the results of two parallel experiments yields a valid estimate. I propose a statistical test to assess the validity of estimates from double list experiments by leveraging variation in the order in which respondents receive the sensitive item, which provides researchers with a tool to apply this technique more widely.\nAs another example, in work under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting a research design feature aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision, but it may require contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates before treatment and then post-treatment outcomes. This creates space for either explicit (e.g. subjects dropping from the study between waves) or implicit sample loss (e.g. resource limitation forcing researchers to halve the sample size). Both forms of sample loss may offset the precision gains of blocking. Both standard and block randomized experiments have well-known unbiased estimators, but one must choose whether to block or not depending on the expected gains in precision. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage.\n\nMy expertise in the design and analysis of experiments has also informed collaborations in gender and politics and crime and political violence. In work in progress with Michelle Dion (McMaster) and Jordi Díez (Guelph), we use a list experiment in Argentina to understand patterns of sensitivity bias in support for same-sex marriage. We find that the direction on sensitivity depends on social and contextual pressures. For example, men tend to over-report their support for same-sex marriage, whereas women tend to under-report it. Our study also provides guidelines to design studies that can directly capture these subgroup effects.\nIn a collaboration spanning multiple papers with Ines Fynn Universidad Católica del Uruguay), Verónica Pérez (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we document the extent of violent and non-violent criminal governance strategies in Montevideo, Uruguay. This is a context of high state presence and relatively low crime in the region, yet criminal organizations remain embedded in the territory through the use of these tools. This means our substantive contribution is to shift attention toward cases that are not well explained by conventional theories. Methodologically, use this application as an opportunity to further expand the range of social science tools available to measure sensitive attitudes and behaviors by combining the innovations I introduce to list experiments with the network scale-up methods, a technique that is more popular in the health sciences."

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\n\nAccording to Freedom House, 2022 marks the 17th consecutive year with available data in which the number of countries where democracy deteriorated outnumbers the number of countries where democracy improved. This trend emerges after several decades of continuous democratization and highlights the difficult path that separates democratization and consolidation.\nThis period is also marked by redoubled efforts by scholars, governments, and civil society organizations to identify and overcome the challenges to democracy around the world. Progress in research transparency and registration has lead to more coordinated efforts to produce credible evidence to determine what works, where, and why.\nMy research focuses on the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation in the Global South, with regional focus in Latin America. The common theme across these topics is a concern on how strategic behavior from both citizens and politicians precludes accurate measurement and the identification of successful interventions. My main agenda analyzes the unintended electoral consequences of investigating and exposing corruption, and has evolved to focus on the gendered patterns in citizens’ evaluation of politicians’ performance in office.\nGiven the focus on hard-to-observe phenomena, this substantive agenda also informs a methodological program on the application of tools from causal inference and computational social science to navigate research design trade-offs before data collection in quantitative studies. My expertise in these topic has also spurred collaborations in the fields of gender and politics and crime and political violence.\n\n\n\nThe literature in political science and economics on electoral accountability highlights voters’ adverse selection problem: They prefer to have good over bad elected officials but they can only infer an incumbent’s type through observable outputs of their performance. Therefore, corrupt incumbents have incentives to hide illicit activities and appear good. To fight corruption, governments, civil society organizations, and scholars devote considerable resources to implementing and evaluating anti-corruption interventions that attempt to bridge the information gap between voters and politicians’ performance in office. However, the cumulative evidence suggests that these interventions rarely translate into voters sanctioning corrupt incumbents.\nA recent explanation for the lack of electoral sanctions is that politicians undertake preemptive behavior to ward off the negative consequences of corruption. For example, previous research shows that political parties avoid nominating legislators investigated for corruption to reelection. On the other side of the coin, research also shows that local level elected officials switch away from parties investigated for corruption after securing reelection. In short, politicians avoid direct association with corruption.\nPrevious research on electoral accountability shows that politicians try to minimize the electoral consequences of investigating and exposing corruption. I expand on this research in work funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian studies at the University of Illinois, using data from a long-running anti-corruption program in Brazil that randomly selects municipalities to audit their use of federal funds, and combining text analysis and machine learning to create the most comprehensive dataset of corruption infractions to date. I make two contributions to the literature.\nFirst, in a working paper, I argue that the main reason why politicians update their behavior in reaction to increased monitoring is because they expect increased scrutiny from their constituents. This contrasts from previous work suggesting that the primary incentive is top-down enforcement. I show that being selected for auditing leads mayors to shift public spending in a attempt to minimize the chances of uncovering irregularities. Mayors selected for auditing spend less when they are eligible for reelection and when the audits are announced close to an election year. This runs counter to previous evidence in political business cycles, which suggests that heightened electoral concerns lead to an increase in public spending.\nIn another working paper, I argue that politicians are also responsive to revealed corruption even when they are not directly connected to it. Whereas previous literature has shown evidence that partisans might react strategically to anticipated sanctions when their political party is linked to corruption, I argue that this behavior is even more widespread and that politicians fear being caught in an electoral anti-corruption wave even when there is no evidence of their own wrong-doing. This occurs because officeholders expect their constituencies to receive the news of corruption in nearby localities and react with increased scrutiny on their performance.

For example, we use responses to hypothetical survey questions to infer actual behavior, we resort to aggregate election results to understand individual evaluations of politicians’ performance in office, and we conduct randomized controlled trials in some places to determine if a policy is advisable in other places. Doing this credibly requires creativity in how we use data, as researchers must try to anticipate the challenges to inference even before conducting analyses.\nMy research develops standards to navigate the tradeoffs that emerge when one considers research design alternatives before data collection. I use tools from machine learning and design-based causal inference to identify practices and procedures that researchers can adopt to improve how they approach data at the pre-analysis stage. My current agenda focuses on the design of randomized controlled trials. In the future, I plan to expand to causal inference in quasi-experiments and observational studies, as well as the use of machine learning for statistical inference.\n\nI apply the insights of my work in statistics on topics ranging from the challenges to accountability, governance, and representation to questions of misinformation and racial prejudice. The common goal is to improve our ability to make statistical inferences when human behavior prevents us from observing phenomena of interest directly.\n\n\nIn the social sciences, the last decade has seen considerable improvement in research transparency and registration. Borrowing heavily from statistics, recent advances in experimental design provide tools to diagnose the properties of a research design before data collection. For example, one can think about bias, power, or target sample size under different hypothetical data generation processes.\nA recurrent goal in the causal inference literature is to minimize bias, or being close to the hypothetical truth on average. Instead, my agenda focuses on optimizing statistical precision, as in producing consistent estimates after multiple realizations of the same data generation process. The literature implicitly assumes that one cam simply improve precision by increasing sample size. However, this is not feasible in most social science applications due to resource considerations.\nEven if resources are not an obstacle, even the least intrusive study wastes time and energy from researchers, administrators, and participants. This implies an ethical mandate to identify a research design that maximizes benefits and minimizes harm at the lowest possible cost. An emphasis on statistical precision allows researchers to anticipate and internalize these costs before implementation.\nFocusing on randomized controlled trials, this agenda follows two strands. First, researchers often face the choice between alternative experimental designs for which unbiased estimators are already documented. In this case, opting for the design with more precision leads to unforeseen costs in other dimensions. Two projects exemplify how I develop standard to navigate this precision.\nIn a manuscript forthcoming in the Journal of Experimental Political Science, I propose statistical tests to address problems with double list experiments.

The tests leverage variation in the order in which respondents see the sensitive item to detect whether respondents are reacting to list experiment questions in unintended ways. This provides researchers with a tool to apply this underexplored variant of the technique more widely.\nIn a paper under review with Erin Rossiter (Notre Dame), we discuss the circumstances under which adopting research design features aimed at improving precision can instead hurt precision through implicit or explicit sample loss. For example, block randomization often improves precision. However, if this requires contacting participants multiple times to collect blocking covariates first and then post-treatment outcomes, then it creates space for attrition that would not exist otherwise, which may offset the precision gains of blocking. Through simulation and the reanalysis of a survey experiment on misinformation in social media, we illustrate how researchers can entertain this precision-retention tradeoff at the pre-analysis stage.\nThe second reason to focus on statistical precision is that sometimes a more precise yet biased estimator gives more informative answers than an unbiased estimator, which is especially relevant for policy decision-makers. In this case, the researcher is explicitly sacrificing unbiasedness for the sake of precision. Two other projects reflect this issue.\nFirst, in work in progress with Jake Bowers (Illinois) and Christopher Grady (USAID), we discuss the circumstances under which researchers should prefer biased yet more precise estimators in the analysis of experimental data. Once again, an example of this trade-off comes from block-randomized experiments. Block-randomization entails grouping observations in groups or strata, conducting parallel experiments in each, and then calculating a single treatment effect with a weighted average. Previous work in statistics suggests that block-size weights lead to an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect in this setting. However, because experiments are expensive to implement, we illustrate situations under which researchers may prefer to sacrifice unbiasedness in favor of more precise estimates, which would lead to the use of precision weights instead, the equivalent of using fixed effects in OLS regression. We extend this idea to the use of M-estimator for data with skewed outcomes. We illustrate these ideas through simulation and by revisiting the design of a messaging field experiment conducted by the Office of Evaluation Sciences in the United States.\n\nSecond, in a chapter with Christopher Grady (USAID) and Jim Kuklinski (Illinois) in The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, we discuss the trend of increasingly more complex research designs in survey experimentation. For example, short vignettes are replaced with factorial experiments including many attributes. This increase in complexity allows researchers to isolate causal effects from potential confounders, but raises concerns over whether the tasks that respondents face in survey experiments tap into the intended construct outside of the survey framework. In other words, we draw attention to the trade-off between simple designs that risk confounding bias and complex designs that yield unbiased estimates but risk external validity bias.\n\n\n\n\nI plan to use the insights of my work to inform applications in the social sciences. In turn, I aim to use applications as a motivation to further develop tools for statistical inference. For example, in work in progress with with Inés Fynn (PUC-Chile), Verónica Pérez (Universidad de la República), and Lucía Tiscornia (University College Dublin), we apply my work on list experiments to document the extent of criminal governance strategies in Montevideo, Uruguay. We also develops techniques to combine estimates from list experiments with network scale-up questions, a technique more common in the health sciences. This expands the range of tools available measure sensitive attitudes and behaviors through surveys.\nI also plan to expand my research program toward the use of machine learning to improve statistical inference. An early example comes from my dissertation work, funded by the Lemann Center for Brazilian Studies, on the effect of investigating the use of federal funds among selected mayors in Brazil on the behavior of other mayors in nearby localities. My theory suggests geographic spillovers as a quantity of interest, yet it gives no guidelines for how far away that effect would travel. This presents a tradeoff between operationalizations that introduce bias by being too narrow or too broad. I overcame this problem using a penalized regression framework to choose the optimal upper bound. This innovation received the best poster award in the 2019 Latin American Political Methodology meeting."

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\n\n\nAs someone teaching research design and quantitative methods to political science majors, I face the impossible task of conveying mathematical thinking, statistical programming, and their application to academia, policy, and industry to an audience in which the majority of individuals chose their degree to explicitly avoid these topics. Usually, my students start the semester with an appreciation for quantitative research, but find it impossible to produce their own output.\nMy approach to accomplish this within one semester is to unify all these elements as the task of acquiring a new language. A single course will not teach students everything they need to know to become fluent, but it can give enough tools to facilitate future learning in a direction that is beneficial to students with diverse backgrounds and career goals. For some, this may mean engaging directly with data or code. For others, the goal is to communicate productively with data analysts in a future workplace.\nTo accommodate this diversity, I design courses with two principles in mind. First, students need flexibility to engage with the course on their own terms and focus on the content they find useful. For example, the flipped classroom lab sessions in my course on data analysis for public opinion and policy asks students to evaluate a research design, suggest alternatives or modifications, and to evaluate its statistical properties through coding and writing. Some students may propose increasing the sample size, sampling from a different underlying population, or changing the assignment of treatment conditions. This allows students to pursue the tasks that suit their interests and gives me the freedom to reward creativity and effort over correctness.\nThe second principle is accountability, which is necessary to keep everyone on task while allowing flexibility. This means agreeing on an overarching theme that every single course activity must relate to. For example, early on my data analysis course, I introduce the bias-variance tradeoff as a principle to choose among alternative research designs. So, while students are free to propose any modification to an existing research design that they deem appropriate, they are also required to document the explicit or implicit costs that would come from their proposal. They must consider, for instance, that a representative sample is more expensive than a convenience sample, or that implementing a block-randomized experiment may require access to variables that cannot be measured easily.\nFlexibility and accountability also help in preventing instances of discrimination in the learning process. Through flexibility, students are invited to add value to the course by bringing their own perspective, knowledge, or experiences. In turn, accountability sets the scope for the type of contributions of interventions that are admissible. From this perspective, a racist remark is unacceptable not because someone disagrees with it, but because it is beyond the scope of the course vocabulary.\n\n\n\nI have experience teaching substantive and methodological courses to diverse audiences and under different formats. At McMaster, I teach data analysis for public policy and public opinion, with emphasis on experimental and quasi-experimental designs for causal inference. The goal of this course is to give students hands-on experience in designing a quantitative research project in an area relevant to academia, policy, or industry.\nAt Tulane, I taught an undergrad senior course on the challenges of developing democracies from the perspective of evidence-based policy making. This course overviews the main challenges in the path to democratic consolidation around the world, the proposed solutions to these challenges, and how governments, researchers, and civil society organizations use data to evaluate these solutions. The previous version focused primarily design-based causal inference. In future versions of these two courses, I plan to expand the syllabi to include applications of computational social science and machine learning. I also taught introduction to comparative politics, emphasizing theoretical and methodological considerations as the core of the course, while simultaneously encouraging students to apply this knowledge to recent events in a region or country of their choosing.\nIn my time at Illinois, I taught statistics and research methods. In the 2020-2021 academic year, I was the graduate methods teaching assistant in our department. My duties involved advising PhD students taking courses in the quantitative methods sequence, as well as mentoring undergraduates enrolled in the senior honors thesis program. I also served as a teaching assistant for Jake Bowers’ introduction to data analysis for political science majors.

    "text": "Gustavo Diaz\nDepartment of Political Science, McMaster University\ndiazg2@mcmaster.ca\n\n \n\n\n\nAs someone teaching research design and quantitative methods to political science majors, I face the impossible task of conveying mathematical thinking, statistical programming, and their application to academia, policy, and industry to an audience in which the majority of individuals chose their degree to explicitly avoid these topics. Usually, my students start the semester with an appreciation for quantitative research, but find it impossible to produce their own output.\nMy approach to accomplish this within one semester is to unify all these elements as the task of acquiring a new language. A single course will not teach students everything they need to know to become fluent, but it can give enough tools to facilitate future learning in a direction that is beneficial to students with diverse backgrounds and career goals. For some, this may mean engaging directly with data or code. For others, the goal is to communicate productively with data analysts in a future workplace.\nTo accommodate this diversity, I design courses with two principles in mind. First, students need flexibility to engage with the course on their own terms and focus on the content they find useful. For example, the flipped classroom lab sessions in my course on data analysis for public opinion and policy asks students to evaluate a research design, suggest alternatives or modifications, and to evaluate its statistical properties through coding and writing. Some students may propose increasing the sample size, sampling from a different underlying population, or changing the assignment of treatment conditions. This allows students to pursue the tasks that suit their interests and gives me the freedom to reward creativity and effort over correctness.\nThe second principle is accountability, which is necessary to keep everyone on task while allowing flexibility. This means agreeing on an overarching theme that every single course activity must relate to. For example, early on my data analysis course, I introduce the bias-variance tradeoff as a principle to choose among alternative research designs. So, while students are free to propose any modification to an existing research design that they deem appropriate, they are also required to document the explicit or implicit costs that would come from their proposal. They must consider, for instance, that a representative sample is more expensive than a convenience sample, or that implementing a block-randomized experiment may require access to variables that cannot be measured easily.\nFlexibility and accountability also help in preventing instances of discrimination in the learning process. Through flexibility, students are invited to add value to the course by bringing their own perspective, knowledge, or experiences. In turn, accountability sets the scope for the type of contributions of interventions that are admissible. From this perspective, a racist remark is unacceptable not because someone disagrees with it, but because it is beyond the scope of the course vocabulary.\n\n\n\nI have experience teaching substantive and methodological courses to diverse audiences and under different formats. At McMaster, I teach data analysis for public policy and public opinion, with emphasis on experimental and quasi-experimental designs for causal inference. The goal of this course is to give students hands-on experience in designing a quantitative research project in an area relevant to academia, policy, or industry.\nAt Tulane, I taught an undergrad senior course on the challenges of developing democracies from the perspective of evidence-based policy making. This course overviews the main challenges in the path to democratic consolidation around the world, the proposed solutions to these challenges, and how governments, researchers, and civil society organizations use data to evaluate these solutions. The previous version focused primarily design-based causal inference. In future versions of these two courses, I plan to expand the syllabi to include applications of computational social science and machine learning. I also taught introduction to comparative politics, emphasizing theoretical and methodological considerations as the core of the course, while simultaneously encouraging students to apply this knowledge to recent events in a region or country of their choosing.\nIn my time at Illinois, I taught statistics and research methods. In the 2020-2021 academic year, I was the graduate methods teaching assistant in our department. My duties involved advising PhD students taking courses in the quantitative methods sequence, as well as mentoring undergraduates enrolled in the senior honors thesis program. I also served as a teaching assistant for Jake Bowers’ introduction to data analysis for political science majors. This course focuses on flipped classroom learning, letting students engage with the course material on their own time and using lecture time to work as a group on problem sets and research projects. I have also contributed as a math camp instructor for three consecutive years, introducing statistical programming in R to incoming graduate students in our department.

As a PhD student at Illinois, my efforts focused on facilitating out-of-classroom learning opportunities, which I consider essential to break initial entry barriers to the field. At Illinois, I started a quantitative methods cheatsheets project in 2018. In this project, volunteer graduate students write a short introduction to the theory, implementation, and current debates surrounding a technique of their expertise in statistics and data science. These resources are shared in a repository available for current and future generations. The project started with the goal of filling gaps in graduate coursework and quickly shifted to the introduction of new methods. In the same spirit, I also organized a reading group on data science.\nI see a position in a department that plays a key role in unifying data science instruction across campus as the natural progression of my current role, and I am more than eager to assume leadership positions in this regard.
