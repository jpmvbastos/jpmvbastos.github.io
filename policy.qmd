<!-- See about omitting columns by table -->

I have worked as a policy analyst in the Executive and Legislative branches of City of Porto Alegre, Brazil, where I got to work on important economic reforms. 

I also discuss policy issues as a regular contributor to [Exame](https://exame.com/autor/joao-pedro-bastos/), one of the most popular media outlets in Brazil.
