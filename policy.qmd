<!-- See about omitting columns by table -->

I have worked as a policy analyst in the Executive and Legislative branches of City of Porto Alegre, Brazil, where I got to work on important economic reforms. Most notably, a major business licensing reform that reduced the [average time to open a business from 245 to 18 days](https://integrationconsulting.com/en/simplifying-the-business-environment/).

I am also a fellow at [Instituto Millenium](https://institutomillenium.org.br), one of Brazil's leading policy think tanks, and I discuss policy issues as a regular contributor to [Exame](https://exame.com/autor/joao-pedro-bastos/).
