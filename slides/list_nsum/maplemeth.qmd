## Background

::: incremental
- Social scientists care about **sensitive issues**

- Asking about them directly leads to **misreporting**

- **Solution:** *Indirect questioning* techniques

- **List experiments** popular in political science
:::

## Example

Now I am going to read you things that make people angry or upset

## Example {visibility="uncounted"}

After I read them all, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you

## Ways to reduce variance

- Negatively correlated items [(Glynn 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfs070)

- Covariate adjustment [(Blair and Imai 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpr048)

- Auxiliary information [(Chou 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124117729711)

- Double list experiments [(Diaz 2023)](https://gustavodiaz.org/files/research/dle_test.pdf)

- Combine with direct questions [(Aronow et al 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smu023)

- **Combine with direct questions [(Aronow et al 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smu023)**

## Combined estimator

- **Logic:** You don't need a list experiment for those who openly confess to the sensitive item

. . .

$$
\hat{\mu} = \overline{Y} - (1 - \overline{Y}) (\overline{V}_{1,0} - \overline{V}_{0,0})
$$

::: incremental
- $\overline{Y}$: Proportion confess in direct question

- $(\overline{V}_{1,0} - \overline{V}_{0,0})$: List experiment estimate among those not confessing
:::

::: aside
**Source:** [Aronow et al (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smu023)
:::

## Problem

::: incremental
- Can't always include direct questions

- Need an indirect questioning technique that lets us **infer individual responses to sensitive item**

- But most introduce noise to ensure anonymity

:::

## Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM)

. . .

How many people do you know,

## Why NSUM?

. . .

- Can infer **individual** responses to sensitive item

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
## Assumption
If someone knows an unusually large number of people with sensitive item, then they are likely to hold the sensitive item too.
:::

. . .

- If true, can use NSUM responses instead of direct questions

. . .

- **Goal:** Find individuals with large *sensitive network* relative to *personal network*

## Hierarchical model


$$
\begin{align*} 
y_{ik} \sim \text{negative-binomial}( & \text{mean} = e^{\alpha_i + \beta_k},\\ & \text{overdispersion} = \omega_k)
\end{align*} 
$$

::: incremental

- $y_{ik}$: Degree of group $k$ for person $i$

- $\alpha_i$: Expected degree of person $i$ (logged)

- $\beta_k$: Expected degrees of group $k$ (logged)

- $\omega_k$: Controls variance in propensity to know someone from group $k$

:::

## Hierarchical model {visibility="uncounted"}

- Fit with MLE in two steps `(Personal network, sensitive group network)`

- Focus on standardized residuals:

$$
r_{ik} = \sqrt{y_{ik}} - \sqrt{e \alpha_i + \beta_k}
$$

. . .

- **High residual:** Higher exposure to sensitive item

# Application

## Criminal governance strategies in Uruguay

::: incremental
- Low crime, but embedded

- Even here criminal organizations replace government

- **Fieldwork:** Interactions are sensitive topic

- **Goal:** Document extent of exposure to criminal governance strategies `(positive, negative)`
:::

## Survey

- Facebook sample of Montevideo residents `(N = 2688)`

- Four criminal governance strategies

. . .

::: columns

::: {.column width="48%"}
### Negative
- Threaten neighbors
- Evict neighbors
:::

::: {.column width="52%"}
### Positive
- Make donations to neighbors
- Offer jobs to neighbors

## Direct question

During the last six months, in your neighborhood, have you seen gangs...

- Threaten neighbors
- Evict neighbors
- Make donations to neighbors
- **Threatening neighbors**
- Blackmail neighbors
- Blackmail businesses
- Pay a neighbor's phone or electricity bills

## List experiments

```{r}
list0 = tribble(
  ~A, ~B,
  "Saw people doing sports", "Saw people playing soccer",
  "Visited friends", "Chatted with friends",
  "Activities by feminist groups", "Activities by LGBTQ groups",
  "Went to church", "Went to charity events",
  "", ""
)

list0 %>% 
  kbl(col.names = c("List A", "List B"))

## NSUM {#nsum}

How many people do you know, **who also know you, with whom you have interacted in the last year** in person, by phone, or any other channel

. . .

- 15 reference groups + sensitive item

- Choice range 0-10+

- Recode as 1 if $r_{ik} > \text{mean}(r_{ik}) + 1 \text{SD}$

                            "List B + direct" = "List + direct")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "list", values_from = "std.error") %>% 
  mutate(order = c(1, 3, 2)) %>% 
  arrange(order) %>% 
  select(!order) %>% 
  kbl(digits = 3, 
      col.names = c("Estimator", "List A", "List B"))
```


## Conclusion

- Can use NSUM to improve precision of list experiment estimates

- Logic applies to other indirect questioning techniques that rely on anonymity

### Questions

- More principled approach to infer who holds the sensitive item from NSUM questions?

- What would you like to see to be convinced that NSUM is a suitable replacement for direct questions?
